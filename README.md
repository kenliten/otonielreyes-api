# otonielreyes-api
My personal blog's api

This is just a pretty simple api made in vanilla php to managing my posts and projects from a mongodb database cluster and be able to display them using my front end.

Since after the build it's served from the same folder that the front end app, I'm omitting the index.php thing.
